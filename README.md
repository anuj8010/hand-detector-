Hand Detection and Gesture Recognition Project




This project is a web application developed using Next.js and MediaPipe, designed to detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time. It uses MediaPipe's GestureRecognizer, FilesetResolver, and DrawingUtils to provide an interactive experience where specific hand gestures, such as a thumbs-up or detecting the number of fingers held up, can be recognized.







INTRODUCTION






The Hand Detection and Gesture Recognition project aims to provide a seamless experience for recognizing hand gestures in a browser using advanced machine learning models. This application leverages MediaPipe, a powerful cross-platform library, to detect hand landmarks and recognize various gestures using computer vision techniques.

FEATURE











Real-time Hand Detection: Detects hands and landmarks in real-time using a webcam.
Gesture Recognition: Recognizes a variety of hand gestures, including thumbs-up, fist, open palm, and counting fingers.
Interactive Visualization: Uses MediaPipeâ€™s DrawingUtils to visually display detected hand landmarks and gestures on the screen.
Cross-Platform: Built with Next.js, ensuring compatibility across different devices and browsers.
Technologies Used
Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications and static websites.
MediaPipe: A cross-platform framework that provides customizable machine learning solutions, particularly for hand detection and gesture recognition.
JavaScript/TypeScript: The programming languages used to build the front-end and integrate MediaPipe.
WebRTC: Enables real-time video capture from the user's webcam.
